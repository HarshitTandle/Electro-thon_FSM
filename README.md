#ðŸ§  FSM 4-State Verilog Module
This project implements a 4-state Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog with the states: IDLE, LOAD, PROCESS, and DONE. The FSM transitions between states on every second rising edge of the clock, introducing a controlled delay using a simple state counter. A testbench is included to simulate the FSM behavior and display state transitions over time.
